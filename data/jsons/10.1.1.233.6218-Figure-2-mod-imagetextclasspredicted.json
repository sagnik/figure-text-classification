{"Caption": "Figure 2: Distribution of game length, according to different path-length metrics. Black circles: shortest possible paths. Blue X\u2019s: effective human paths (i.e., ignoring back-clicks). Red dots: complete human paths (i.e., including back-clicks). Green plus signs: complete human paths, corrected for drop-out rates. ", "CaptionBB": [73, 248, 407, 319], "Mention": ["Fig. 2 gives a good impression of how the paths found by hu-\nmans compare to optimal solutions (summary statistics of the dis-\ntributions in the figure are provided in Table 1). The red line shows\nthe distribution of human path lengths (where clicks that were later\nundone and back-clicks are counted as regular clicks), while effec-\ntive paths were used for the blue line. For each human game we\nalso computed an optimal solution, and the resulting path length\ndistribution is plotted as a black line. We make three observations:\n", "2. Nonetheless, the effective paths found by humans (the blue\nline in Fig. 2) are typically not much longer than shortest\npaths. Both mode and median search times differ from op-\ntimal by just 1 click (3 vs. 4 clicks), mean search time by 2\nclicks (2.9 vs. 4.9 clicks). (See Table 1.)\n", "3. When considering full path length with undone and back-\nclicks (the red line in Fig. 2), the mode search time is still 4,\nand the mean and median search times are 1 click more than\nfor effective paths (5 vs. 4, and 5.8 vs. 4.9 clicks). That is,\nhumans click back on average once every other game.\n", "of giving up at the i-th step, is roughly constant at around 10%.\nUsing drop-out rates, we can correct for the aforementioned bias\nand compute an ideal search time histogram, for the hypothetical\ncase that participants never give up [6]. The result is shown as the\ngreen line in Fig. 2. Although longer games are more frequent un-\nder the ideal than under the observed distribution, the distributions\nstill look similar qualitatively, with mode 4 and a power-law\u2013like\ntail. The median search time is only 1 click higher (6 vs. 5 clicks),\nand mean search time rises by 3 clicks (8.9 vs. 5.8 clicks). We con-\nclude that the observed human efficiency in Wikispeedia play is not\nexplicable by a sampling bias alone.\nInstead, we conjecture that, even without knowing the set of\nall existing links, the Wikipedia graph is efficiently navigable for\nhumans because they have an intuition about what links to ex-\npect. Clearly, the probability of two articles linking to each other is\nhigher the more related they are. This can lead to efficient naviga-\ntion even in the absence of global knowledge. In particular, Liben-\nNowell et al. [11] have shown analytically that short search times\n(technically defined as polylogarithmic in the number of nodes) can\nbe expected under their model of \u2018rank-based friendship\u2019, viz., if\nthe probability of a node linking to its r-th closest fellow node\ndecays as 1/r. Intuitively, such a scenario is desirable because it\nconstitutes an appropriate mix of many short- and a few long-range\nlinks. The latter are helpful for getting somewhat close to the target,\nwhile the former are necessary for fully reaching it.\nWe strive to investigate whether the Wikipedia graph satisfies\nrank-based friendship. Humans may tap into all their knowledge\nand reasoning skills during play, so it is hard to formalize their node\ndistance measure. In the present analysis, we therefore coarsely\napproximate the human by a standard text-based distance measure\nand define the similarity of two articles as the cosine of their TF-\nIDF vectors [12] (and distance as one minus similarity). Fig. 5\nplots the link probability P(r) as a function of rank r. The black\nline was added to show an ideal slope of \u22121, as postulated by the\nrank-based friendship model. Note that, although P(r) does not\nfully follow a power law, the overall slope of the curve comes close\nto \u22121, which leads us to conclude that Wikipedia is conducive to\nefficient navigation because its links represent an appropriate mix\nof long- and short-range connections across concept space.\n", "1.
