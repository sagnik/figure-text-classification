{"Caption": "    Figure 1: (best in color) Multi-flick scrolling technique. Recently, designers and researchers have introduced flick- ing as an intuitive and natural form for throwing objects in virtual environments [23] and for shifting content within a viewport [10,23]. Multi-flick refers to the idea that flicks can potentially be used recurrently to easily explore a vari- ety of scrolling distances. This is because a wide range of velocities can be specified, with very little change in posi- tion or movement, simply by adjusting the way in which consecutive flicks are combined. Han (TED Talk, www.ted.com) demonstrated the fluidity of multi-flicking off-screen content into and out of a multi-touch display. Hinrichs et al. [14] utilize multi-flicking with a stylus to control the flow of documents moving on the periphery of a tabletop. iPhone\u2122 and iPod\u2122 multi-flick as a natural ", "CaptionBB": [440, 481, 775, 728], "Mention": ["backward, if the directional vector appears in the top-right \nquadrant or the bottom-left quadrant of the display, respec-\ntively.
