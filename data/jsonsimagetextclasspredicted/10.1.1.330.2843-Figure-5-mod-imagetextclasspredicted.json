On the other hand,\nif the Roomba travels in the same area, the camera localiza-\ntion is actually expected to improve with more actions. This\nis due to the fact that the topological map will become more\ndensely filled with positions that the Roomba has visited be-\nfore. However, the camera localization is not perfect. There\nis still significant error and noisy readings will throw off the\nposition considerably (for example, see the spike in Fig. 5).\nAlso, the method requires the actual path to contain cycles.\nIf there are no cycles, the topological camera localization\nwill perform no better than just using pure odometry. For-\ntunately this was just the first step to validate the approach.\nThere are many ways to improve the algorithm.\n"], "ImageBB": [115, 96, 366, 271], "ImageText": [], "Number": 5, "GoldLabelsTagged": true, "Height": 1100, "Caption": "Figure 5: Experiment 1 positional error of commanded posi- tion vs. topological camera localization position.
