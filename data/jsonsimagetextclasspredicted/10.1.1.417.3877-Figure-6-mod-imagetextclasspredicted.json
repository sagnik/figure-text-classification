The\nestimation based on the Lie algebra is better than the lin-\nearization for transformation of all norms. The ratio is al-\nmost constant and on the average the linearization have 12%\nlarger error. The estimations with orientation histograms\nare significantly better than the intensity based features.\nIn the second experiment, we show tracking examples for\nseveral challenging sequences. In all the experiments, the\nparameters of the ridge regression were \u03bb = \u03b3 = 2.10\u22123,\nwhich were learned offline via cross validation. The train-\ning dataset is generated on the Lie algebra, by giving ran-\ndom values between\u22120.1 and 0.1 to each of the six parame-\nters. Notice that, although we track the targets with an affine\nmodel, almost none of the targets are planar. Therefore, an\naffine model can not perfectly fit the target but produces the\nbest affine approximation.\nIn Figure 7, a ball having large motions is tracked. The\nLie algebra (first row) based estimation accurately tracks the\ntarget, whereas using linearization (second row) the target is\nlost after a few seconds. In the following sequences, only\nLie algebra based estimations are shown.\nSince nonplanar objects undergo significant appearance\nvariations due to pose changes, the model update becomes\nimportant. In Figure 8, we show the effect of the update\n"], "ImageBB": [450, 100, 733, 306], "ImageText": [], "Number": 6, "GoldLabelsTagged": true, "Height": 1100, "Caption": "Figure 6.
