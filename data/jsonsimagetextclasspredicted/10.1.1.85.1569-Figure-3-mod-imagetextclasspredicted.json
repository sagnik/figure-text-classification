The results are shown in Figures 3. From the graph we\ncan see that the fraction of zeros in the SBF decreases until\nit becomes stable. When the allocated space is small, the\nconvergence rate is higher. This is because when the space\nis larger, the probability a cell being set is smaller. From\nCorollary 2 and Eq. 6 we know the convergence rate should\nbe lower in this case. Also, we can see that when the SBF\nis stable, the fraction of zeros is still \ructuating slightly.\nThis can be caused by the input data stream whose under-\nlying distributions is varying. Furthermore, the fraction of\n0s keeps decreasing in general before being stable; at this\npoint, the FP rate should reach its maximum, and our theo-\nretical upper bound for FP rates is also valid before the SBF\nbecome stable in this case. Our next experiments show the\ne\u000bectiveness of our theoretical FP bound. When the space\nis relatively small, the real FP rate is close to the bound.\n"], "ImageBB": [89, 73, 393, 267], "ImageText": [], "Number": 3, "GoldLabelsTagged": true, "Height": 1100, "Caption": "Figure 3: Fraction of zeros changed with time on the whole real data set (Max=1, K=2, P=4, FPS=10%), space unit=64bits ", "SomethingWrong": true, "Type": "Figure", "Page": 10, "DPI": 100}
